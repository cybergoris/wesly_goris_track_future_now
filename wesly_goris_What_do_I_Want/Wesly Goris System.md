## Daily Macro Targets

  

| Phase | Calories | Protein (g) | Carbs (g) | Fat (g) | Timeline |

|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|

| Phase 1: Aggressive Cut | 2,800 | 280 | 196 | 93 | Months 1-3 |

| Phase 2: Moderate Cut | 3,080 | 308 | 224 | 103 | Months 4-6 |

| Phase 3: Lean Cut | 3,360 | 336 | 252 | 112 | Months 7-9 |

| Phase 4: Maintenance | 2,800 | 200 | 240 | 98 | Month 10+ |

  

> **Note:** Based on 280 lb starting weight, 200 lb goal weight. Adjust accordingly.

  

### Macro Guidelines

- **PROTEIN:** 1g per lb bodyweight - essential for muscle preservation

- Spread protein across 4-5 meals (40-50g per meal)

- **CARBS:** Time around workouts - 50% pre/post workout

- **FATS:** Essential for hormones - don't go below 0.3g/lb

- **HYDRATION:** Minimum 1 gallon (128oz) water daily

- **FIBER:** 25-35g daily for satiety and digestion

## Progressive Overload Rules

  

> **The key to gaining strength and muscle**

  

1. **Add weight when you hit the TOP of rep range with good form**

2. **Increase weight by 5 lbs for upper body, 10 lbs for lower body**

3. **If you miss reps, stay at same weight until you hit target**

4. **Deload every 4-6 weeks** (reduce weight by 40% for 1 week)

5. **Track EVERY workout** - what gets measured gets managed

## 10-Month Progression Plan

  

### Example: Bench Press Progression (Starting at 95 lbs)

  

| Month | Weeks | Focus | Rep Range | Weight Increase | Est. Weight | Sets |

|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|------|

| 1 | 1-4 | Foundation/Form | 8-12 | +5 lbs/2wk | 95 lbs | 3 |

| 2 | 5-8 | Building Base | 8-10 | +5 lbs/2wk | 105 lbs | 3 |

| 3 | 9-12 | Strength Phase 1 | 6-8 | +5 lbs/2wk | 120 lbs | 4 |

| 4 | 13-16 | Strength Phase 2 | 6-8 | +5 lbs/2wk | 135 lbs | 4 |

| 5 | 17-20 | Intermediate | 5-8 | +5 lbs/3wk | 150 lbs | 4 |

| 6 | 21-24 | Building Power | 5-8 | +5 lbs/3wk | 165 lbs | 4 |

| 7 | 25-28 | Peak Phase 1 | 4-6 | +5 lbs/3wk | 180 lbs | 4 |

| 8 | 29-32 | Peak Phase 2 | 4-6 | +5 lbs/3wk | 195 lbs | 4 |

| 9 | 33-36 | Advanced | 3-6 | +5 lbs/4wk | 210 lbs | 5 |

| 10 | 37-40 | Maintenance | 5-8 | Maintain | 220 lbs | 4 |

  

**Projected Gain: +125 lbs on bench press**

  

---

  

## Sleep Optimization

  

> **Critical for Results - Minimum 6 hours, Optimal 7-8 hours**

  

- Sleep deprivation increases cortisol → promotes fat storage

- Growth hormone peaks during deep sleep → muscle repair

- Poor sleep increases hunger hormones (ghrelin) by 28%

- Aim for consistent bed/wake times within 30 min daily

- No screens 1 hour before bed

- Keep room cool (65-68°F)
